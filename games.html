      Epic Games' Unreal Engine 5 took the gaming community by storm. Tons of new features were announced that aim to
      enhance the overall gaming experience. One of these new features is Lumen, a dynamic global illumination system.
      Lumen allows artists and developers to break free from creating static worlds without hits to loading times.
      Multi-bounce global illumination is now possible without the need for light maps or baking. Another benefit of
      Lumen is that it doesn't just react to moving light sources, it also reacts to changes in geometry.

      <p>Another feature being worked on is Nanite, a truly virtualized geometry system. With Nanite, artists won't need
        to be concerned about poly counts, draw calls, or memory. This system can also achieve pixel accurate shadows.
        In the demo "Unreal Engine 5 Revealed!" Nanite is able to crunch down 1 billion triangles of source geometry in
        each frame in the
        starting cave to just 20 million drawn triangles. It also allows for 8k textures to be used throughout the
        environment.</p>

      <p>MetaSound is a new sound system within Unreal Engine 5. Every sound effect In the demo "Welcome to Unreal
        Engine 5 Early Access" was made using it. MetaSound brings a fine control for creating procedural game audio
        with its full audio synthesis capabilities and large audio function library. Sound designers can also layer
        sound
        samples with synthesized audio. Sound wave generators and modulation widgets allow for a unique sound design
        experience.</p>

      <p>Other features in Unreal Engine 5 include the Niagra effects system, improved interactive fluid systems,
        improved animation system, and the Chaos physics system. In the demo "Unreal Engine 5 Revealed!" the Niagra
        effects system was used to create a swarm of bats and bugs crawling away from the light. Particles in Niagra are
        able to communicate
        with one another to understand their environment like never before. The improved fluid simulations allow for
        real-time displacement under the character's feet. The improved animation system offers predictive foot
        placement and motion warping to dynamically modify IK and body position for a more natural look. Additionally,
        the Chaos physics system accurately simulates the rigid bodies of falling rocks, and the cloth of the
        character's scarf.</p>

      The developers at DRAMA recently published their gameplay trailer for Unrecord which broke the internet. Unrecord
      is a single-player first person shooter that tells the story of a tactical police officer through the perspective
      of his body camera. The reason Unrecord gained so much attention is because of its stunning graphics. The game is
      being developed in Unreal Engine 5, and utilizes features mentioned in the paragraphs above. Some viewers are
      skeptical and say the gameplay trailer is real-life footage. This led its developers to post a behind the scenes
      clip of them no-clipping through the playable environment.

      MOREFUN STUDIOS published an official CG release trailer for its game Arena Breakout. The trailer is an intense
      and hyper-realistic short film that follows a team of soldiers trying to survive amidst gunfight. Everything from
      the characters and 3D assets, to the textures, materials, and compositing is nearly perfect. To unexpecting
      viewers, this trailer could pass as real-life footage. Sadly, Arena Breakout is a first-person shooter mobile
      game, which means the incredible graphics seen in the release trailer were more or less a marketing stunt. Still,
      the production quality of this trailer has left gamers eager for the future of hyper-realistic games.
