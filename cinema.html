      <li>When you think of Unreal Engine you probably think of games. However, Unreal Engine is becoming increasingly
        used
        for virtual film production. In the video "The Future of Cinema" ICVFX Stage Operator and Epic Games employee
        Mike Sill gives an in depth look at how they pull off their virtual production. It all starts with a motion
        captured
        camera which is tied directly to Unreal Engine. This means it's possible to capture live footage with a
        digitally
        tracked environment as the background. The live recorded data gets sent to a physical control station as well
        where artists can do digital comp in real-time.

        <p>One benefit to this approach of virtual film production is that
          the background and lighting will always be consistent. This means if an actor wore the wrong tie for instance,
          they could redo the scene months later with no other differences in the production. Additionally, there isn't
          a
          large film crew dragging their equipment to an inconvenient location while fighting against the sunlight. </p>

      <li>The green screen has been used by filmmakers for decades to replace backgrounds and composite actors. Keying
        green screens isn't always as simple as a VFX artist may hope. For example, seams may stand out, and uneven
        lighting can cast different shades of green across the green screen. This then leads to an increase of manual
        labor. Fortunately, a
        new approach that utilizes LED panels could potentially be taking its place. What's being referred to as "the
        volume" is a wall of high resolution LED panels that wrap around a stage, with a matching physical set design,
        and
        3D assets projected into the digital environment. The environment can also respond to camera movements,
        mimicking
        the real world.

        <p>Charmaine Chan is credit as part of the "Brain Bar" Crew responsible for operating the volume on
          the set of The Mandalorian. A benefit to this workflow is that environments could be completely reworked
          within
          hours. Constant adjustments
          to 3D assets, animations, and color could be made in real-time. Another benefit is that post-production
          workers
          like Charmaine who would normally be editing in the corner of a room got the chance to interact with the
          gaffers, prop designers, set designers, and other crew members she wouldn't usually get to see.</p>

      <li>This video by artist Lorenzo Drago is nothing short of visually
        stunning. It provides a look at what digital environments utilizing
        Unreal Engine 5 can look like. The train station is based on a real-life location in Toyama, Japan. It was built
        using 3D assets, but the scene can easily pass
        as real-life footage. Lorenzo makes use of Unreal Engine's global illumination system, Lumen. He also worked on
        all the modeling, texturing, lighting, and animation. The main goal of this project was to get as close to
        photorealism as possible. For the realistic camera movements, lorenzo used camera matching to get accurate
        proportions and reference.</li>

      <li>Short film "Irradiation" written and directed by Sava Zivkovic is a 3D animated short made with tools
        including Unreal Engine, Blender, Zbrush, Substance Painter, and Adobe Suite. A motion capture facility was used
        for the animation data of the characters. This short features amazing storytelling, voice acting, and incredible
        virtual production. </li>
