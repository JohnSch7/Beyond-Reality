      <h2>MetaHuman Creator</h2>

      <p>One of the hardest aspects to get right when creating a digital character is the face. This includes sculpting
        a
        realistic model, texturing the skin, and animating all its features. It's notoriously difficult and
        time-consuming
        for even the most skilled 3D artists to create a convincing digital character. This is where Epic Games'
        MetaHumans come in. MetaHuman Creator allows artists to make their own digital characters with ease.</p>

      <p>MetaHuman
        Creator comes with presets and selectable styles for each part of the face. There's also a sculpting mode which
        allows artists to redefine desired areas of the face. Real-time updates let artists see their changes instantly
        which allows constant adjustments to be made. Once the character creation phase is finished, artists can export
        their model to Unreal Engine to animate and render the MetaHuman.</p>

      <h2>MetaHuman Animator</h2>

      <p>MetaHuman Animator is a newer feature made by Epic Games. It captures the facial performance of an actor and
        maps
        the motion capture data to the face of a MetaHuman in Unreal Engine. In the video demonstration linked above,
        Melina Juergens
        does a live performance in front of a phone using the Live Link Face mobile app developed by Epic Games.</p>


      <p> MetaHuman
        Animator uses video and depth information to convert the performance into a high-fidelity animation. It can also
        analyze the audio to produce convincing tongue animations.

        A MetaHuman that resembles Melina's facial features is
        generated by using the video from her performance. This is referred to as her MetaHuman DNA which also generates
        a
        rig that can predict all of her facial expressions. Once the video processing is finished, the motion capture
        data and MetaHuman model can be dropped into the Unreal Engine timeline and rendered.</p>
