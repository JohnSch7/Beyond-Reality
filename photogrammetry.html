      Photogrammetry allows artists to reconstruct an objects shape, positioning, and materials through analyzing a
      set of photos taken at different angles. Photogrammetry takes the place of traditional hand modeling in 3D
      software. Mason Menzies, Photoscanning Manager at Poliigon relates photogrammetry to automated camera tracking.
      When trying to track the motion of a camera, software will often look for high detailed areas as reference for
      understanding the spatial positioning of a scene. Photogrammetry works very similarly. The process will attempt
      to track the same high detailed areas across a large dataset of images. This is how the shape and positioning of
      the object is reconstructed in a 3D space.

      Although photogrammetry seems like a great tool for turning any real-life object into a 3D asset, there are
      some
      areas that fall short. For example, reflective and translucent materials are difficult to scan. The same can be
      said about objects that are smooth and pristine. The lack of details makes it hard for Photogrammetry to
      correctly process the object's positional data. Additionally, repeating patterns on an object can also confuse
      the processing. To give you an example, photogrammetry works better with something like a jagged rock with a
      bunch of detail, than a smooth white ceramic vase.

      One of the reasons Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare II looks so realistic is because of how photogrammetry was
      used. In the real world, props were damaged to simulate wear and tear, then scanned into a digital workspace.
      This saved weeks of time and allowed for more precise details to be added. Instead of having multiple cameras
      taking pictures of a prop from different angles, the Arago rig utilizes one camera and automatically rotates the
      prop on a turntable.
